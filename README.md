# Customer Segmentation

Welcome to the Customer Segmentation repository! This project leverages machine learning techniques to perform customer segmentation, a critical task in marketing and business strategy. By dividing customers into distinct groups based on their behavior, characteristics, and preferences, businesses can tailor their marketing efforts and product offerings to better meet the needs of each segment.

## Project Overview

Customer segmentation is a fundamental task in marketing analytics, enabling businesses to understand their customer base and target specific segments with personalized marketing strategies. This project aims to explore and apply various machine learning algorithms to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior, demographic information, and other relevant features.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the raw customer data to prepare it for machine learning modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze and visualize the data to gain insights into customer behavior, patterns, and trends.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extract and create relevant features from the data to improve the performance of machine learning models.
- **Model Training**: Train machine learning models, such as clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, hierarchical clustering), to segment customers into distinct groups.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluate the performance of the segmentation models using appropriate metrics, such as silhouette score, inertia, or silhouette analysis.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the results of customer segmentation to facilitate interpretation and decision-making.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer_segmentation.git`
2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required Python libraries specified in the `requirements.txt` file using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. **Preprocess Data**: Clean and preprocess the raw customer data using techniques such as data imputation, normalization, and encoding.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data and understand customer behavior.
5. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features from the data or create new features to improve the performance of segmentation models.
6. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models (e.g., K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering) on the preprocessed data to segment customers.
7. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the segmentation models using appropriate evaluation metrics and visualization techniques.
8. **Interpretation**: Interpret the results of customer segmentation and derive actionable insights for marketing and business strategy.
